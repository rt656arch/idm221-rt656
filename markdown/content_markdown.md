# About Me
Hi! I am Rachel Tang, a current undergrad student at Drexel University studying UX/ID (user experience and interface design). I started out as a Computer Science major but switched over to UX/ID as I found I preferred researching and designing over coding. I enjoy reading romance books, eating delicious food and painting in my free time.
