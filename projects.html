    <h1> Design I for Media </h1>
    <h2> Project 0 </h2>
    <p> Worked with shapes to create a static and dynamic composition 
        and pick ones that contrast well with each other and paint 
        them with acrylic. 
    </p>
    <h2> Project 2 </h2>
    <p> Manipulated line weight and type to create a dynamic abstract design. Use 
        my initials to create dominant foreground design and line repetition (inspired
        by photos) to create a subordinate background. 
    </p>
    <h2> Project 3 </h2>
    <p> Picked a scene with good contrast from a black and white film and recreated it 
        as a self protrait. Then using the self portrait and create 2 value studies. 
    </p>
    <h2> Project 4 </h2>
    <p> Worked with space and perspective. 
        - Created a value scale through mixing black and 
        white acrylic paint. 
        - Created a one and two point perspective drawing, and painted in 
        the two point perspective using the value scale. 
        - Used photoshop to animate a ball going through the two point perspective painting
